# Airlines-Analytics-and-Insights
Airline Analytics through Machine Learning Approaches  

# Basic Idea  

* Regardless of data size, our Airline Analytics application should provide insights quickly from data analysis.  

* Analytics users who are tired and having to go through multiple dashboards(Tableau, QlikView), will get insights which are in form of text and can be easily understandable.  

* Insights will be presented in terms of a storyboard.  

* Storyboards provide users with wide variety of benefits which include contextual, actionable and consumable insights.  

# Approach

* Data Engineering
* Data Analysis - Machine Learning Approaches  
* GUI - Presenting Storyboards of insights obtained from analysis.
